This is cl-oauth, an implementation of the OAuth 1.0a standard
in Common Lisp.

Spec URI: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a

Section numbers mentioned in the code and documentation
refer to this document, unless mentioned otherwise.

Most of the code has passed basic manual and automated
tests, but it hasn't been used in a real-world application
yet.


Not supported at this time:

  * parameters from Auth header (needs some parsing) [5.4]
    in principle a MUST, but as SP you get to decide ;)

  * Nonce checking [9], a SHOULD.

  * signatures different from HMAC-SHA1 (it's easy to use other
    digests and MACs via Ironclad but RSA needs to have padding
    implemented). [9.3]

  * PLAINTEXT signature. Meh. [9.4]


People who contributed in some way to this library:

  * Leslie P. Polzer <polzer@gnu.org>: base implementation.


TODO (apart from spec things not implemented yet):

  * grep the code for TODO and FIXME

  * incorporate test cases from http://wiki.oauth.net/TestCases

  * abstract token storage, can't get far with volatile memory
    FETCH-TOKEN/STORE-TOKEN

  * better handling of different protocol versions; in particular
    we should support serving both 1.0 and 1.0a clients (and requesting
    stuff from 1.0 and 1.0a servers too, of course).


  * better support for Consumers

    * examples, convenience interface

    * SIGNATURE-BASE-STRING must accept the list of parameters as argument
      for the Consumer
