This is CL-OAuth, an implementation of the OAuth 1.0a standard
in Common Lisp.

Spec URI: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a

Section numbers mentioned in the code and documentation
refer to this document.


Not supported at this time:

  * parameters from Auth header (needs some parsing).

  * signatures different from HMAC-SHA1 (it's easy to use other
    digests and MACs via Ironclad but RSA needs to have padding
    implemented).


People who contributed in some way to this library:

  * Leslie P. Polzer <polzer@gnu.org>: base implementation.
