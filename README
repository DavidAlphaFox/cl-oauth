This is CL-OAuth, an implementation of the OAuth 1.0a standard
in Common Lisp.

Spec URI: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a

Section numbers mentioned in the code and documentation
refer to this document.


Not supported at this time:

  * parameters from Auth header (needs some parsing) [5.4]
    in principle a MUST, but as SP you get to decide ;)

  * Additional parameters in server response [6.1.2]. Optional and trivial.
    Additional parameters in request (store in tokens).

  * Nonce checking [9], a SHOULD.

  * signatures different from HMAC-SHA1 (it's easy to use other
    digests and MACs via Ironclad but RSA needs to have padding
    implemented). [9.3]

  * PLAINTEXT signature. Meh. [9.4]


People who contributed in some way to this library:

  * Leslie P. Polzer <polzer@gnu.org>: base implementation.


TODO (apart from spec things not implemented yet):

  * incorporate test cases from http://wiki.oauth.net/TestCases

  * abstract token storage, can't get far with volatile memory
    FETCH-TOKEN/STORE-TOKEN

  * better handling of different protocol versions; in particular
    we should support serving both 1.0 and 1.0a clients (and requesting
    stuff from 1.0 and 1.0a servers too, of course).


  * better support for Consumers

    * examples, convenience interface

    * SIGNATURE-BASE-STRING must accept the list of parameters as argument
      for the Consumer
