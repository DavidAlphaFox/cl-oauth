This is CL-OAuth, an implementation of the OAuth 1.0a standard
in Common Lisp.

Spec URI: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a

Section numbers mentioned in the code and documentation
refer to this document.


Not supported at this time:

  * parameters from Auth header (needs some parsing) [5.4]

  * Additional parameters in server response [6.1.2]. Trivial.

  * Timestamp checking [8]. Trivial.

  * Nonce checking [8, 9].

  * signatures different from HMAC-SHA1 (it's easy to use other
    digests and MACs via Ironclad but RSA needs to have padding
    implemented). [9.3]

  * PLAINTEXT signature. Meh. [9.4]


People who contributed in some way to this library:

  * Leslie P. Polzer <polzer@gnu.org>: base implementation.


TODO (apart from spec things not implemented yet):

  * incorporate test cases from http://wiki.oauth.net/TestCases

  * abstract storage, can't get far with volatile memory

  * better support for Consumers (examples, convenience interface)

  * move service provider convenience stuff to examples

  * abstract *issued-{request,access,consumer}-tokens* hash table access
